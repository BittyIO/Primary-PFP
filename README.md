*So keep looking until you find your ForeverPFP. Don’t settle…* -Web3 mfs

## Why ForeverPFP?
- By binding your forever PFP to your address, it helps PFPer(not flipper) find each other easier.
- While we can set avatar in ENS, but without ownership verification, you can set other people's PFP image, we need verify the ownership to make the PFP data onchain works.
- PFP holder can have more than one PFPs in one address, but for the social networking better knowing your "face", it would be better choose a forever PFP by binding it.
- This project is inspired by [Primary ENS Name](https://app.ens.domains/faq#what-is-a-primary-ens-name-record) ENS name, [ForeverPunk](https://twitter.com/foreverpunksnft) and [delegate.cash](https://delegate.cash).

## What is ForeverPFP?
- Register a PFP for an address like Primary ENS Name.
It will provide getPFP(address) function to web2 website by lib like [wagmi](https://wagmi.sh/) allowing mfs using ethereum address to sign and get their PFP image in tokenURI of the PFP.
- A PFP verification list without copycats maintained by the community.
Verify PFP collections to avoid same image copycat confusing people by a community instead of centralized company like opensea.
